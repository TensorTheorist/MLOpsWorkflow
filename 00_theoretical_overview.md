# OVERVIEW

## Python based development for core ML functionality
* Python -> local system development [move to cloud or on-prem solution]
* Easily access databases in Python: BigData with Spark and Pandas
* Huge store of ML libraries and models already written in Python

## Technologies for deployment 
* On-prem -> requires DevOps
* Cloud managed -> requires cloud skills

## Jupyter access on a VPS (Virtual Private Server)
* SSH passwordless access on a VPS -> [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/), [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/), [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/)
* Setup a basic firewall
* Acess the server locally using SSH tunneling

## Saving and loading ML models
* Natively save and load models in [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) or [skLearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html)
* Use [MLFlow](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/index.html)
